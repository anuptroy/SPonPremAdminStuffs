Customer was facing issue with people picker
When he was trying to add users he was getting prompt "Sorry we're having trouble reaching server"

# we ran sharepoint management shell as an administrator
# we ran the following command to check 
1. $w = get-spwebapplication <WEB URL>

E.g. 
 $w = get-spwebapplication https://www.majesconet.com

2. $w.peoplepickersettings
# The we found that user have migrated website multiple times 
# Then we decided to flush peoplepicker config with the following command
3. stsadm -o setproperty -url <Web URL> -pn peoplepicker-searchadforests -pv “”

E.g.  stsadm -o setproperty -url https://www.majesconet.com -pn peoplepicker-searchadforests -pv “”

# After successfully flushing we perform IISRESET
# ask cs to browse site and try to add users
# now cs was able to add users
# issue solve
