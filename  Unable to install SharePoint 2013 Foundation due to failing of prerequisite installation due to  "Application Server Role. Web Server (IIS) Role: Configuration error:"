=======================

> When asked cx about the ISO download, customer was not sure about the source of it.
> So we rechecked customers requirement.
> He wanted to install SharePoint 2013 Foundation for a single server installation.

> So we downloaded the SharePoint Foundation 2013 with SP1 from : https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=42039 
> Started installation of the same, prereqs installed successfully.
> Then started installation of SharePoint setup which failed at "The product requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5"
> Even after uninstall of the dot net updates, we were failing on the same steps.
> After multiple attempts 
> Followed below method to get it working 
> Run regedit.exe as administrator
> Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4
> Right-click the v4 node, click Export, and save the export file somewhere safe - you will need it later
> Right-click the v4 node and click Permissions
> Click Advanced
> Change the Owner to your administrator account, tick "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects", and click OK
> Go through each node under v4 and:
> Right-click the node and click Permissions
> Set your administrator account to have Full Control and click OK
> Change any Version value you find from 4.6.x to 4.5.x (I used 4.5.51209)
> Ran setup for SharePoint 2013 and we see the "Run Configuration Wizard" screen.
> Completed the setup in single server mode.
> Ran PSCONFIG which completed successfully.
> Issue resolved.
