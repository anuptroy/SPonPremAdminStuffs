· It takes times to create new wb application
· While creating web application through UI it throws error " This page cant be displayed"
· Check IIS for the specific created site > explore and check all the necessary folders were created
· Then we tried to created We application via PowerShell command :
· New-SPWebApplication -Name "Contoso Internet Site" -Port 80 -HostHeader sharepoint.contoso.com -URL "https://www.contoso.com" -ApplicationPool "ContosoAppPool" -ApplicationPoolAccount (Get-SPManagedAccount "DOMAIN\jdoe")
· Via PowerShell command web got created successfully
· Then ask cs to create web app again with UI
· It still throws same error
· Done some research 
· By that time ask cs to delete all web applications which were created
· Then we perform the following action: 
· For Central Admin App Pool > Process Model > Shutdown Time Limit value was 90 sec by default.
	 
· We change it from 90 sec to 300 sec.
 
· Perform IISRESET
 
· After this we refresh Central Admin Site.
 
· Then we proceed with creation of New Web App, It took some time after which web app got created with new site collection successfully without any error.
 
· Made a host file entry for the specific web application which was created. 
 
· While browsing site it was asking for credentials multiple times, then we ran the following command.
	New-ItemProperty HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa -Name "DisableLoopbackCheck" -value "1" -PropertyType dword 
 
Then we were able to browse URL successfully
