Kindly find the below steps to change the workflow manager certificate If Expired Trouble shooter.
 
custom certificate
 
· You have a custom certificate (not auto-generated) that expired yesterday on your single-server WFM and Service Bus Farm. 
· Thumbprint:  DABDF0481EA1F71B06CF03B5061249D4670C03DE - is the expired certificate 
· This needs to be changed using these instructions : https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/whereismysolution/2017/02/08/changing-my-workflow-manager-farm-certificates/  
· You will need a new certificate that is identical to the first in order to do this, that starts at an earlier time than expiration.  
· We can make a temporary certificate using PowerShell to do this (while the time is put back on the server):  
· New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "wfmserver.fred.com", "*.fred.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"  
· You will need to update it with your DNS name ie. *.nwc.com.sa 
· You have WFM 1.0 CU3 installed, but possibly only Service Bus 1.0 and not service Bus CU1 
· Please check what patched have been applied to your farm using “installed updates” in programs and features” 
· I recommend that you apply Service Bus CU1: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36794  if you do not have it already 
· Back up your databases before making the CU and certificate changes.
