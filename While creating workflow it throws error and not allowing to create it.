+then we navigated to web.config of that web application where the Workflow setting was not functioning and throwing error
+under the section :

<trust level="Full" originUrl="" legacyCasModel="true" />

+we replace the value from "true to "false"
+after making this change ans saving it at web.config level
+we ask to check the behavior
+now workflow setting was functioning properly without getting error
+case is solved and good to close
