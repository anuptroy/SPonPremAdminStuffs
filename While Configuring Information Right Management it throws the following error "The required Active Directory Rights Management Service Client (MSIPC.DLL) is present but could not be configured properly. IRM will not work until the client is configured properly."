6. Click Edit, and then click Add.
7. Click Object Types, select the Computers check box, and then click OK.
8. Type YourSharePointServerName, and then click OK. (note: If your SharePoint service/application pool is a domain account you can, and should give it rights here as well. If you have multiple application pools, you might need to add them if they require RMS support)
9. Click OK to close the ServerCertification.asmx Properties sheet.
By default the Read & execute and the Read permissions are configured for the SharePoint server computer account object and all other accounts inherited from the parent folder. (make sure to set Allow Inheritable Permissions on ServerCertification.asmx).
It's good practice to specifically give the SharePoint Application Pool accounts these rights as well.
