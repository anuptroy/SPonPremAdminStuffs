Issue Definition: Need assistance in configuring Application Gateway – backend throwing 401. 
Resolution : 
Ø We looked into the configuration and could see that the Application Gateway’s backend was throwing 401. 
Ø Later you informed us that the Application works on SSL and hence configured end to end SSL.
Ø We tried to add the status code in the Application gateway configuration, but we continued to see the same error. 
Ø We looked into the application configuration on IIS, however were not sure about the site/page that would respond for the probe. 
Ø We then involved my colleagues from IIS and SharePoint teams to help us. 
Ø By then, you informed us that the issue was resolved after you configured the probe on “probe.competenz.org.nz”
