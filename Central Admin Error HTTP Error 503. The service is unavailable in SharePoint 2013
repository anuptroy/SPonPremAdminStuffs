Reason : Change of password by me /Password Expired
 
Troubleshooting:
Tried to update password with stsadm –o updatefarmcredentials –userlogin <domain/username> -password <new password> but did not worked 
 
Then Tried to update the password manually in each server
 
1. In AD:
	Updated the PASSWORD in AD (Active Directory)
	Under ->domain (contoso.com)->clicked Users folder->name -Administrator; type-User-In Properties-Account-check the box on password never expires


2. In SQL Server Configuration Manager
	Under SQL Server Services - right clicked on each service of the same domain(like Contoso\administrator) then clicked on properties 
	and updated the password 
	Note: Give 1st priority of password update to default instance MSSQLSERVER then to other services
	Then restarted each services
Tried to access the Central admin site and it restarted


3. In IIS, Clicked on Application pools option 
	Then by right clicking on each site on application pool->Advanced setting ->clicked on identity and by clicking on 3 ellipses-> updated the password 
Then started each sites whatever is present in application pool by right clicking
