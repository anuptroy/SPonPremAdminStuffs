Share{Point was unable to resolve users from AD

Thus perform the below commands:

# https://joelblogs.co.uk/2011/06/02/sharepoint-2010-peoplepicker-not-finding-active-directory-users/

$site = get-spsite "<SITE>"
$site.UserAccountDirectoryPath

Set-SPSite -Identity "<SITE>" -UserAccountDirectoryPath ""

IISRESET

Now we were able to get user resolve
