Symptom

When trying to find users using the SharePoint 2013 or 2016 people picker control, it spins for several seconds and then displays: 
Sorry, we’re having trouble reaching the server
 
 
If you take a Fiddler trace, you’ll see that the POST to the CSOM endpoint (_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery) gets stuck in an authentication loop between client.svc, _login/default.aspx, and _windows/default.aspx.
Cause

The authentication settings had been manually changed at the IIS level.
For a Window-Claims web application, the following authentication methods must be enabled at the site level in IIS:
·         Anonymous Authentication
·         ASP.Net Impersonation
·         Forms Authentication
·         Windows Authentication

Resolution

Open IIS manager, select the site in question, and double click “Authentication” in the middle IIS Manager pane.
 
·         Make sure Anonymous Authentication is enabled and the identity is set to “IUSR”
·         Make sure ASP.NET Impersonation is enabled and set to impersonate “Authenticated user”
·         Make sure Forms Authentication is enabled.
·         Make sure Windows Authentication is enabled, and the enabled Providers agree with what is set for the web application in Central Administration (for example: NTLM).
 
Note: These settings are for a Window-claims authenticated web app.  For other authentication types, I recommend you deploy an out-of-box web app using the same authentication type and compare the IIS-level settings with what the customer has.
