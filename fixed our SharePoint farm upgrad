How I fixed our SharePoint farm upgrade woes (Note: run all PowerShell (PS) commands in an elevated PowerShell window – *need 2 pre-opened windows*)
 
· Turn off all the following services (you can do this in your first PowerShell window)
	net stop SPTraceV4; net stop SPWriterV4; net stop SPAdminV4; net stop SPTimerV4; net stop w3svc
 
· Manually stop both search services (in the services GUI on the SP server) – Note: SP 2010 only has 1 Search Service.
 
· Run the following command in your second PowerShell window
	stsadm -o setproperty -pn command-line-upgrade-running -pv No
 
· Flush the Config Cache follow this blog post
 
· Run the following PowerShell in your second PowerShell window
	PSConfig.exe -cmd upgrade -inplace b2b -wait -force
 
· As soon as it reaches step #3 in the upgrade process, in the first elevated PS window, run the following PS
net start SPTraceV4; net start SPWriterV4; net start SPAdminV4; net start SPTimerV4; net start w3svc
 
· Quickly manually start the two search services (in the Services GUI on the SP Server)
	 
· The upgrade process should complete successfully after this
